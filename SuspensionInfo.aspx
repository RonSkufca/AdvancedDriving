    <h1>Suspension Information</h1>
    <p class="medium">There are many ways you can have your license suspended in Ohio.
                      If your license has been suspended don't worry we are here to help
                      get you back on the road. Depending on the individual's situation
                      you might be able to receive limited driving privileges while your suspension is in force.
    </p>
    <p class="medium">If you have two to 11 points on your license, you are eligible to take our remedial driving course
                      approved by the Department of Public Safety, where you will receive a two-point credit. 
                      However, completing this course does not mean that two points will be taken off your license. 
                      Instead, it means that your license will be suspended if you reach 14 points, not 12. 
                      You can take this course up to five times, but no more than once every three years.
